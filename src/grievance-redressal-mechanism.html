            At <strong>Fundly</strong>, we take enormous pride in building our franchise revolving around what our
            customers truly want. Most of our products and processes revolves around this fulcrum.
            While we grow with this endeavour, we do understand that customer complaints are part of
            any business, and this offers us an opportunity to understand customer issues.

            To make Fundly&apos;s redressal mechanism more meaningful and effective, we have put in a
            structure which is just, fair and abides by the regulations prescribed by regulator for our
            Partner Regulated Entities.
